## About
Thanks for visiting!
This repository contains the openEHR models (Archetypes and a Template) for representing the [UK Resuscitation Council ReSPECT process](https://www.resus.org.uk/respect).

These were designed for and by [NES Digital Service](https://nds.nhs.scot/) of NHS Scotland.

They are being used to provide an application for clinical and care teams to create and manage respect agreements in NHS & Care Scotland.
